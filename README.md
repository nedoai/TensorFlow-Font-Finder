# Font Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

A project for font classification using deep learning and convolutional neural networks.

## About

This project is a solution to the font classification task using convolutional neural networks (CNN). We train a model on a dataset consisting of various fonts and then use this model to predict fonts on new images.

## Features

- Training a deep neural network for font classification.
- Use of data augmentation methods to enhance model performance.
- Monitoring and saving the best model weights using callbacks.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.10.9 or else. I write on 3.10.9)
- TensorFlow (version 2.13.0 or higher)
- Keras (version 2.13.1 or higher)
